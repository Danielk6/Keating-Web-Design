        <dt>Parachutes</dt>
        <dd>Colplay's debut album, this album contains a number of very beautiful and diverse tunes.
            It features the track "Yellow" which propelled Coldplay to worldwide fame. Chris Martin's falsetto
            really shines, but unlike later albums, the songs have a better balance of musical freedom among the
            band members (most notably the bass). Compared to later albums, Parachutes may seem less polished and mature,
            but fans of Coldplay will have at least one favorite track from this album (and not all the same one).

        <dt>A Rush of Blood to the Head</dt>
        <dd>
            A Rush of Blood to the Head, while still featuring the same instruments and musicians, really showed that
            Coldplay could mature their music from one album to the next. Featuring beautiful tracks like "The Scientist" and "Clocks,"
            the album really flows together thematically. With more political lyrics in "Politik" and "A Rush of Blood to the Head",
            Chris Martin put on a display of musical expression and edginess that simply was not present in Parachutes.

        <dt>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</dt>
        <dd>
            In an era of singles, Viva la Vida reminded people what an album was really about. Unlike other popular piano-heavy bands
            like the Fray, Coldplay again shifts their album's theme and musical style. Songs like "Yes" and "Lost!" showcase their willingness
            to try new styles. Breaking up the status quo even more, they hid bonus songs into 3 of the 10 tracks, which enhances the album's 
            "piece of art" feel, rather than a collection of singles. While tracks like "Viva la Vida" got significantly more play time on the radio,
            all songs support each other and provide a nice variety listening to the album in order. Definitely their most popular album, it still
            retained the distinctive Colplay musical stamp (think Chris Martin's falsetto and beautiful piano parts). That said, its popularity
            could draw criticism from the original fan base, as the tracks themselves are less musically risky and harder to relate to individually.
