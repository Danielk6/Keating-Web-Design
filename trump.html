    <h2>Donald Trump</h2>
    <h4>The President's Impact on America's Political System</h4>
</div>
<div>
    <h5>Introduction</h5>
    <p>
        In a politically polarized country, it should have come as no surprise that the top two candidates were seen as polarizing figures.
        It should also have come as no surprise that the winner was the more polarizing candidate, running openly on an "America First" promise
        and the pledge to literally build a wall between America and half of its land-bordering neighbors. Many were afraid that Donald Trump would
        carry through on his promises, and just as many were afraid that he would not. Trump campaigned against elitism and corruption, despite
        being an icon of corruption himself whilst bragging about his elite education. His primary connection to the common voter was his willingness
        to blame and make fun of others, doing whatever was popular and expedient at the time. <em>A polarizing figure, Trump may ironically bring the nation
        together simply through scandal as his personality exposes the flaws and weaknesses in our political system. </em>
    </p>
    <h5>Scandals</h5>
    <p>
        It is hard to start discussing Trump's personality without first discussing the scandals. Scandals insert themselves in everything he does,
        and actually serve as a rather effective smokescreen to what is actually going on. However, despite how early this presidency is, it has already 
        caused a rather drastic change in the news media. The Washington Post has remembered its Watergate-exposing roots and is doing its utmost to expose
        corruption at all levels of government, though particularly the executive branch. Other media has discovered that the 1st amendment appears to be 
        under threat and is pre-emptively fighting back. Even networks biased towards the other side of the isle find it hard to ignore some of the scandals.
        The main piece that Trump's scandals have exposed about our political system is that we have to learn to pick our battles. The media has finally hung
        on to one scandal (Russia) and kept the investigation going. The political scandal rollercoaster can only be stopped by picking a spot and flooring the
        break pedal. This means that for future politicians, they will learn that you cannot keep giving the public adrenaline-boosting scandal shots to keep
        them from overdosing on the last scandal. It doesn't mean that the government will be less corrupt;
        <i> it means that the government will respect the boundaries on corruption.</i>
    </p>
    <h5>Narcissism</h5>
    <p>
        Trump's personality has spawned a great many number of articles, some of which start doing psychological diagnoses. While psychologists advice
        against these public diagnoses of a public persona, everyone pretty much agrees that Trump is a narcissist. It always needs to be about him,
        and it needs to be bigger and better.

        </blockquote>
        </a>
    <p>
        Public roles, when first envisioned at the creation of America, were supposed to be an honor and <strong>about serving the public</strong>. With Trump,
        it is increasingly clear that he wants the public to like him. While this can be the same thing, it is not. Trump answers his own question, <q>How am I doing?
            Am I doing OK?</q> by answering himself that he is President, as though running the country was the same thing as a popularity contest.
        This is not really something that Trump has changed; JFK's attractiveness showcased how much being President was about being popular. However, Trump has
        taken this further to make it the only thing, citing Sean Spicer's ratings as a reason to keep him as Press Secretary. This will lead to more pressure for
        political qualifications in the future in an attempt to counterbalance populism as the population realizes that theh Presidency should not primarily be a
        "learning experience," but a <u>job</u>.
    </p>
    <h5>Corruption</h5>
    <p>
        Working on conjunction with his narcissistic personality, Trump handles things very similar to most historical and modern dictators. He puts a huge premium
        on family and loyalty. However, it is important to note that this is very likely one-sided, as he shows great willingness to dump loyal supporters that cease
        to make him look good. With accusations of nepotism, particularly in regard to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, it is likely that after Trump there will be new laws
        about family positions. In addition, there will be likely stricter laws on conflicts of interest in the executive branch, and not just at the presidential level.
    </p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
        It may seem like the government will get more restrictive in response to Trump, but it is important to note that the government may be unrecognizable in the form 
        that does so. Trump may be the golden straw that breaks the democracy camel's back, so his impact may be felt in the exact opposite way of the above at first. Restrictions
        and regulations are being repealed and removed as quickly as possible, and much like the last helicopter out of Vietnam, many people may simply look for self-preservation
        rather than a collective response. However, a collective response is the likely outcome of Trump's presidency, however long it lasts. The jokes about his <small>small hands</small>
        may seem childish compared to the damage he causes to the current political system. Muscles may get stronger when they tear and repair themselves, but they can only withstand
        so much damage before they can't repair themselves without help.
